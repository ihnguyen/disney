# How did Shang-Chi do? Twitter Sentiment Analysis


Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings has been one of the most anticipated super-hero movies this year.
As an Asian American, there hasn't been much representation of Asian American in movies so it was a breath of air to see the change especially from film companies with large positive reputation such as Disney.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, seeing the film in theaters was daunting but the fact that the movie was available in the streaming service Disney+ gave many the opportunity to view with no hesitation. After a few months since Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings has been released in theaters and streaming services, what is the sentiment towards the movie? Twitter data was analyzed to determine the sentiment of the movie against ten emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust, negative, and positive.


A random sample size of 5000 twitter data or tweets were collected on November 21st, 2021. Any tweets that contained the word "shang-chi" was searched against the database. A wordcloud was conducted to determine what words were frequently used alongside "shang-chi" but the data provided no relationships or associations between words; therefore, the wordcloud was omitted from this study. A bar plot was made to investigate the sentiment of tweets that contained "shang-chi" and indicated that there is high positive and anticipation sentiment towards the film (Figure 1). Interestingly, the fear emotion was the third highest sentiment according to the data. Further investigation should be performed to determine why this is. Anger and disgust were the lowest rated sentiment scores which is a good indicator that the movie was well received.
